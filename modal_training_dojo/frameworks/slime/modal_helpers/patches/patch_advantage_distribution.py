"""Patch slime's ``log_rollout_data`` to also emit per-group advantages.

slime logs only the *mean* advantage per training step (in
``log_rollout_data``, which reduces ``rollout_data["advantages"]`` to a single
number). This patch injects a one-line call to our phase-reporter at the top of
that function so we additionally capture the full per-sample advantage
distribution, tagged with each sample's GRPO prompt group, and ship it to the
dashboard's ``/api/advantage-distributions`` endpoint.

The reporter self-guards (TP-rank-0 / last-PP-stage / CP-rank-0) and is a no-op
when the dashboard status URL is unset, so the injected call is safe on every
rank. Executed at image-build time via ``python3 <this file>``.
