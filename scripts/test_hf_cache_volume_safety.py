"""Validate that every file mounting a volume at /root/.cache/huggingface also
clears the directory during image build.

Modal volumes cannot mount on non-empty paths.  Several base images (slime,
sglang, vllm) ship with files under /root/.cache/huggingface after pip install,
so every image that mounts the HF cache volume must include a
``rm -rf /root/.cache/huggingface`` (or equivalent) in its build commands.

This script greps the source tree for the pattern and flags any file that
mounts the volume but omits the cleanup — the exact bug that caused
crashlooping serve apps with the error:

    Runner failed with exception: cannot mount volume on non-empty path:
    "/root/.cache/huggingface"

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/test_hf_cache_volume_safety.py
