"""Deploy (or stop) a PR's dashboard backend as its own Modal app.

The frontend preview is static nginx, so before this its ``/api`` had to be
proxied at the deployed dashboard — a PR that changes both halves of the
dashboard then previewed its new frontend against the old API. Each PR now gets
its own copy of the backend, deployed in preview mode (no scheduled jobs, no
warm container) from the PR's checkout.

Run with plain ``python``, not ``modal run``:

    python scripts/previews/dashboard_api.py deploy 489
    python scripts/previews/dashboard_api.py stop 489

``deploy`` prints the app's web URL as its last line.
