# Fighting LLMs in Street Fighter III

Instead of collecting prompts to train your model against,
you can synthetically generate data using an
[environment](https://gym.modal.dev/guides/recipe#environment).

Here, we show how we train [Qwen3-VL-8B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct)
on Street Fighter III using self-play. To enable this, we use the
[OnlineRollout](https://gym.modal.dev/reference/onlinerollout) class and a
custom generate function.

You can find the [full code here](https://github.com/modal-projects/sf3/tree/main/src/train).

## Creating the environment and reward function

We create our environment by defining a custom generate function.
Here, there are two fighters in a match which sample button sequences
from the current policy to feed into the
[Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)-style environment
concurrently.

For the reward, each move choice is scored based on its net damage (i.e., dealt minus taken) from that point to the end of the round and discounted using a[TD-lambda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_difference_learning) approximation. So in ideal play, we actually expect the sum of all rewards to be 0.

```python
MODEL = Qwen3_VL_8B()
GAMMA = 0.9

_fights: dict[tuple[int, int], asyncio.Task] = {}


async def sf3_generate(args, sample, sampling_params):
    from slime.utils.types import Sample

## Setting up a self-play recipe

Since the above logic is implemented as custom hooks, we can plug them into
the `Qwen3_VL_8B_Recipe` class. When you start training, watching the reward
curves will not be that useful: instead, you'll want to watch the `Metrics` tab in the
[dashboard](https://gym.modal.dev/guides/dashboard) (e.g. `train/entropy_loss` for
policy collapse and `train/ppo_kl` for update size) in addition to running
[offline evals](https://github.com/modal-projects/sf3/tree/main/src/eval) (e.g., win rate against the base model).

Each rollout runs 16 matches with two players each. Since rollout generation is slow, we set `global_batch_size` to a quarter of the rollout and take four optimizer steps per rollout instead of one.

```python
NUM_ROLLOUTS = 20

ROLLOUT_BATCH_SIZE = 16
N_SAMPLES_PER_PROMPT = 2
GLOBAL_BATCH_SIZE = ROLLOUT_BATCH_SIZE * N_SAMPLES_PER_PROMPT // 4

model = Qwen3_VL_8B()
recipe = Qwen3_VL_8B_Recipe(
    custom_generate_function=sf3_generate,
    dynamic_sampling_filter_path="src.train.rollout.sf3_valid_group",
    image_overlay=lambda image: create_gameplay_image(
        base_image=image,
        copy=True,
        add_python_source=True,
    ),
    num_rollout=NUM_ROLLOUTS,
    save_interval=5,
    rollout_batch_size=ROLLOUT_BATCH_SIZE,
    n_samples_per_prompt=N_SAMPLES_PER_PROMPT,
    global_batch_size=GLOBAL_BATCH_SIZE,
    rollout_max_response_len=MAX_TOKENS,
    extra_config={
        **Qwen3_VL_8B_Recipe().extra_config,
        "micro_batch_size": 8,
        "custom_megatron_init_path": "src.train.rollout.megatron_init",
    },
)

config = TrainConfig(
    model=model,
    dataset=OnlineRollout(n_rows=ROLLOUT_BATCH_SIZE),
    recipe=recipe,
)

with config.launch() as run:
    print(f"run id: {run.training_run_id}")
    checkpoint = None
    while True:
        done = run.done()
        latest = run.latest_checkpoint()
        if latest is not None and latest != checkpoint:
            checkpoint = latest
            print(f"new checkpoint: {checkpoint.path}")
        if done:
            break
        time.sleep(30)
    if checkpoint is None:
        raise RuntimeError("run produced no checkpoint")
    print(convert_megatron_checkpoint_to_hf(checkpoint, model).path)
```
