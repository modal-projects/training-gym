# # Efficient inference using on-policy distillation
#
# For workloads where you need the throughput and/or cost-savings of a smaller model,
# but the capabilities afforded by a larger model, on-policy distillation (OPD) is
# an effective and practical way to hit your targets. In this tutorial, we'll use
# [Qwen3.5-9B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B) to teach the smaller
# [Qwen3.5-4B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B) how to satisfy
# writing constraints from
# [allenai/IF_multi_constraints_upto5](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/IF_multi_constraints_upto5).
# When we do offline evals, we'll use the held-out
# [allenai/IFBench_test](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/IFBench_test).

# <details>
# <summary>How does OPD work?</summary>
#
# In addition to the standard RL algorithm, during each rollout step,
# the student's response token IDs are sent to the teacher which returns
# per-token log-probabilities. This changes the advantage, the extra signal each token
# gets based on how much better or worse the response was than expected, as follows:
#
# $$
# A_t = A_t^{\text{GRPO}} - \lambda_{\text{opd}} \cdot (\log \pi_{\text{student}} - \log \pi_{\text{teacher}})
# $$
#
# The first term represents sparse rewards for correct answers,
# while the second term represents the dense signals that push towards the
# teacher's token-level distribution. Together, they teach the student
# what to say (i.e., getting the correct answer) and how to say it (i.e.,
# how the teacher would respond).
#
# </details>
#
# To do cross-family OPD (i.e., use a teacher from a different model family such as Deepseek), see
# [this tutorial](https://gym.modal.dev/tutorials/cross_tok_distill).

# which are not currently supported by Endpoints when speculative decoding is
# enabled. So we instead use a
# [CustomDeployment](https://gym.modal.dev/reference/customdeployment)

# ## Creating a reward function
#
# To use our scoring function for training, we have to modify some framework-specific
# functions. Luckily, this is relatively painless.
#
# <details>
# <summary>How OPD defines KL</summary>
#
# KL-divergence is defined as:
#
# $$
# D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P \| Q) = \sum_x P(x) \log \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}
# $$
#
# where $P$ is the behavior distribution and $Q$ is the target distribution.
#
# Forward KL treats the teacher model as $P$ and the student model as $Q$. However, the
# $\log \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ term would then be weighted by the teacher model's probability distribution $P$,
# resulting in high surprisal on modes unfamiliar to the student model.
#
# To counter this, OPD uses "reverse" KL divergence to grade the student model's output:
#
# $$
# D_{\mathrm{KL}}(\pi_{\mathrm{student}} \| \pi_{\mathrm{teacher}})
# $$
#
# where our student model is treated as the behavior distribution and
# the teacher model is our target distribution.
#
# When the teacher has high surprisal on a student mode, the term $\log(P(x)) - log(Q(x))$
# will yield a high positive KL divergence to penalize the student model.
# Now, the student model only gets penalized on modes relevant to itself.
