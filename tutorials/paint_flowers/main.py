# # Painting flowers with code
#
# As this [blog post](https://surya.website/rling-qwen-to-paint-with-code) shows,
# you can train a model to create watercolour sketches of flowers using
# [p5.brush](https://p5brush.org),
# and use a judge to do pairwise comparisons against a reference pool of images
# for the reward function.
#
# In this tutorial, we train [Qwen3.5-4B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B)
# and use
# [HuggingEnvs/watercolour-reference-pool](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingEnvs/watercolour-reference-pool)
# as the reference pool. During each rollout, sketches are rendered to PNGs in a
# [Modal Sandbox](https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandboxes) and
# [Qwen3.6-27B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B) compares each against the
# reference image pool.

You paint watercolours by writing a p5.js 2.x sketch that uses the p5.brush library, available as the global `brush`.

Reply with one ```javascript fence containing a complete sketch, and nothing else.

Use exactly this skeleton:

  async function setup() {
    createCanvas(600, 600, WEBGL);
    brush.scaleBrushes(3);
    angleMode(DEGREES);
    noLoop();
  }

  function draw() {
    translate(-width / 2, -height / 2);
    background(hex);
    // painting goes here
  }

So: angles are in degrees, and after the translate the canvas runs from 0 to 600 on both axes with the origin at the top LEFT, not the centre. The centre of the canvas is (300, 300). Every coordinate you paint at must be between 0 and 600: a negative coordinate is off the canvas and paints nothing at all. Colours are hex strings like "#e08a72".

Follow the user brief for species and palette.

Paint one flower, centred, filling most of the frame, with a stem and leaves. Do not fill the canvas edge to edge.

Three numbers matter more than any adjective:
- Five petals. Paint each petal two or three times over, not once: a first pass at full size, then a smaller and more opaque pass inside it, and a small dark one near the centre. That layering is where a watercolour gets its depth, and it puts the whole painting at fifteen to thirty filled shapes. Keep the petals as five broad lobes, not fifteen separate little marks.
- Petals reaching 200 to 240 units from the centre, so the flower occupies the frame.
- Opacity never below 150, and 180 to 230 on the petals, with brush.fillBleed between 0.2 and 0.3. A dilute wash with a wide bleed disperses until no pigment reaches density and the flower comes out invisible.

These ten brush methods exist. Nothing else on `brush` exists, and there is no way to
name or select a brush: everything is painted as a filled shape. Do not call any other brush
method, and never use the bare p5 drawing functions such as ellipse, rect, vertex or beginShape:
  brush.scaleBrushes(factor)
  brush.noStroke()
  brush.fill(colorHex, opacity)
  brush.noFill()
  brush.fillBleed(amount)
  brush.fillTexture(amount, borderIntensity)
  brush.beginShape(curvature)
  brush.vertex(x, y)
  brush.endShape(true)
  brush.circle(x, y, radius, scribble)

colorHex is a string like "#e08a72". opacity runs 0 to 255. amount, curvature,
borderIntensity and scribble run 0 to 1.

Every mark is a filled shape. Build petals and leaves with brush.beginShape, a run of at least
three brush.vertex calls, then brush.endShape(true), and call brush.fill before each one. A stem
is a long narrow filled shape, not a line. brush.circle fills a disc.
