"""Patch Miles SGLang abort cleanup to tolerate transient router reads.

Rollout can complete successfully and then fail during cleanup if the
SGLang router briefly refuses/interrupts the ``/list_workers`` request
used to fan out aborts. In that case there may be no remaining pending
tasks to abort, and treating the router read as fatal kills the whole
Ray job after useful rollout data has already been collected.

Executed at image-build time via ``python3 <this file>``.
