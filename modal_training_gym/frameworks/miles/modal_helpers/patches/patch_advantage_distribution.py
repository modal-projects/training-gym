"""Patch miles' train-side ``log_rollout_data`` to also emit per-group advantages.

miles logs only the *mean* advantage per training step (in
``miles/backends/training_utils/log_utils.py:log_rollout_data``, which reduces
``rollout_data["advantages"]`` to a single number). This patch injects a
one-line call to our phase-reporter at the top of that function so we
additionally capture the full per-sample advantage distribution, tagged with
each sample's GRPO prompt group, and ship it to the dashboard's
``/api/advantage-distributions`` endpoint.

The reporter self-guards (TP-rank-0 / last-PP-stage / CP-rank-0) and is a no-op
when the dashboard status URL is unset, so the injected call is safe on every
rank. Executed at image-build time via ``python3 <this file>``.
